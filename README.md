#### About Me

I am an accomplished problem solver & strong leader with over 20 years of development experience, in a variety of backend & frontend technologies. These include a strong foundation of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Docker, GitOps, DevOps/Infrastructure management & other backend technologies. I have worked with organizations, ranging from startups to large corporations. I understand what it takes to build a productive software engineering team & culture.

While I am not chasing down bugs or building the next "Big Thing", I enjoy tinkering with all kinds of IoT devices, software and home automation gadgets. I am also an avid amatuer radio listener and hack around on trunk recorder quite a bit, listening to local radio traffic. Some of my favorite projects are below.
